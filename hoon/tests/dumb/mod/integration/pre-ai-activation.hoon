::    Consensus-safety tests for the window BELOW ai-pow-activation-height
::    (015-logos). The invariant: a node running the dual-puzzle code at any
::    height h < ai-pow-activation-height must make byte-identical consensus
::    decisions to a pre-Logos (014-aletheia) node. Any divergence at an
::    activation-gated code path forks upgraded nodes from un-upgraded ones
::    before AI-PoW ever goes live. Each arm pins one gate's pre-activation
::    branch:
::      - proof-version:        %ai-pow (v3) blocks are REJECTED below activation
::                              (+proof-version-valid-at-height / validation),
::      - ZK difficulty regime: the ZK ASERT re-anchor switches EXACTLY at
::                              activation, so pre-activation targets use the
::                              unchanged Aletheia (regime-1) computation,
:::      - version recording:    pre-activation block versions are height-derived,
:::                              never stored in block-versions,
:::      - full chain:           a chain built entirely below activation accepts.
::    bc-pre-ai activates AI at height 8 with the ZK re-anchor phase at 8 and
::    anchor at 7, so heights 5..7 are post-asert (fund slots + ASERT targets)
::    yet strictly pre-AI-activation — the exact window a real mainnet node
